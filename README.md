# TipCalculator

This is a Tip Calculator application for iOS submitted as the [pre-assignment](https://gist.github.com/timothy1ee/7747214) requirement for CodePath.

Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

Completed:

 * [x] Required: User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
 * [x] Required: Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
 * [x] Optional: Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.
 
Notes:

Spent some time making the UI work across multiple phone resolutions by playing around with the RelativeLayout.
